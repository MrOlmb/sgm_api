## Architecture Overview

**SGM Backend** is a member management system for the Gabonese Association of Congo, handling member registrations, document verification, and digital membership cards.

### Core Technology Stack
- **Express.js** API with comprehensive middleware stack
- **PostgreSQL** database with **Prisma ORM**
- **Clerk** for authentication and user management
- **Cloudinary** for document/photo storage and processing
- **Nodemailer** for email notifications with HTML templates
- **Zod** schemas for input validation
- **Winston** for structured logging

### Authentication System
- **Clerk integration** provides JWT-based authentication
- **Role hierarchy:** MEMBER ‚Üí SECRETARY ‚Üí PRESIDENT
- Users must complete both Clerk signup AND local registration
- Local user sync via `POST /api/auth/signup` and `POST /api/auth/signin`

### Key Business Logic

**Registration Flow:**
1. User signs up via Clerk
2. Complete registration with required documents: ID front/back, selfie photo
3. Secretary reviews and approves/rejects with form code assignment
4. Approved members get QR code and digital membership card
5. **Email notifications** automatically sent for approval, rejection, or account deactivation (only to members with email addresses)

**File Upload Requirements:**
- 3 required photos: `id_front_photo`, `id_back_photo`, `selfie_photo`
- JPEG/PNG only, max 5MB each
- Automatic Cloudinary upload with optimization (800x600, quality optimization)
- Stored in `sgm/id_documents/` folder structure

**Email Notification System:**
- **Nodemailer integration** with configurable SMTP settings
- **HTML email templates** with responsive design for all notifications
- **Conditional sending** - only sends to users with email addresses
- **Three notification types:**
  - Form approval (with form code and congratulations)
  - Form rejection (with specific reasons and next steps)
  - Account deactivation (with suspension details)
- **Graceful failure handling** - system continues working if email service is unavailable
- **Comprehensive logging** of all email operations

### Database Schema Key Points
- **User model** contains both Clerk sync data and registration details
- **Status field:** PENDING ‚Üí APPROVED/REJECTED workflow
- **Signature model** for president signature management on cards
- **AuditLog** tracks all significant actions for compliance
- All file references stored as Cloudinary URLs

### API Structure
- **Health endpoints:** `/api/health` (basic) and `/api/health/detailed` (comprehensive)
- **Auth endpoints:** User signup/signin sync and status checks
- **Registration endpoint:** Complete member registration with file uploads
- Role-based access control throughout

### Security Features
- Multi-tiered rate limiting (general: 100/15min, auth: 5/15min, uploads: 10/hour)
- Helmet for security headers, CORS configuration
- Input sanitization and Zod validation on all endpoints
- File type/size validation for uploads

### Environment Requirements
Essential variables: `DATABASE_URL`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

**Email Service Variables (for notifications):**
- `EMAIL_HOST`: SMTP server (e.g., "smtp.gmail.com")
- `EMAIL_PORT`: SMTP port (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
- `EMAIL_SECURE`: "true" for SSL (port 465), "false" for TLS (port 587)
- `EMAIL_USER`: Email account username
- `EMAIL_PASS`: Email account password/app password
- `EMAIL_FROM`: From email (optional, defaults to EMAIL_USER)
- `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`: From display name (optional, defaults to "SGM Association")

### Development Patterns
- **MVC structure:** Routes ‚Üí Controllers ‚Üí Services pattern
- **Error handling:** Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP codes
- **Logging:** Winston with file outputs (`logs/error.log`, `logs/combined.log`)
- **Validation:** Zod schemas in `src/schemas/`
- **Middleware:** Authentication, security, and upload handling in `src/middleware/`

### Adding New Features
1. Create route in `src/routes/`
2. Add controller in `src/controllers/`
3. Implement service logic in `src/services/` 
4. Register route in `src/app.js`
5. Add Zod validation schema in `src/schemas/`
6. Test with appropriate role permissions

### Database Changes
1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npm run db:migrate` to create migration
3. Update `prisma/seed.js` if needed
4. Use `npm run db:studio` to verify changes

The system is production-ready with Docker support, comprehensive logging, and follows Node.js security best practices.
